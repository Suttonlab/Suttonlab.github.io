							<h5><strong>Biography</strong></h5>
							<hr>
							<p>
								I am a graduate student at the Niels Bohr Institute of Physics in Copenhagen, Denmark, although I am involved in a variety of coursework, research, and projects elsewhere. My specific interest is in complex physics, inverse problems, and computing, with field focus in both therapeutic Neuroscience/oncology and space engineering/instrumentation.<br />
								<br>
								In my undergraduate years I studied at the University of California, San Diego, earning a BSc  Physics w/Specialization in Computational Physics degree, and a Joint BSc in Mathematics & Economics. I was also awarded two Minor degrees in Linguistics and History. In 2019, I was a visiting student to Lund University (Sweden), and travelled to Copenhagen often, where I came to know NBI. I am now pursuing my MSc there in Physics w/Specialization in Complex Systems, with a thesis on the way. In the first half of 2023, I will be a Visting graduate to the University of Edinburgh's School of Physics and Astronomy, where I hope to conduct research in a variety of applied Physics settings.
